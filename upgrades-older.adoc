== 5.0.x > 5.5.x

[IMPORTANT]
.Python >= 3.6 is needed
====
There is a BREAKING CHANGE here because you need to upgrade to python >= 3.6. one solution
could be upgrade to upgrading to Ubuntu >= 18.04 and regenerate the virtualenv with the
new python version.

[source,bash]
----
$ cd ~/taiga-back
$ mkvirtualenv -p /usr/bin/python3 taiga
$ workon taiga
$ python --version
Python 3.6.9    # or latest
----
====

Follow the default process.


== 4.2.x > 5.0.x

Follow the default process.



== 4.0.x > 4.2.x

Follow the default process.

The migration could take a long time if you have a large database.



== 3.4.x > 4.0.x

Follow the default process.
Please note that several libraries were updated in this release so
it is very important to not miss the `pip install -r requirements.txt` step.



== 3.3.0 > 3.4.x

Follow the default process.

The migration could take a long time if you have a large database.

You should to reload the fixtures with:

----
cd taiga-back
workon taiga
python manage.py loaddata initial_project_templates --traceback
----


== 3.2.3 > 3.3.x

Follow the default process.

The migration may take a long time if you have a large database.


== 3.1.0 > 3.2.x

Follow the default process.



== 3.0.0 > 3.1.0

[IMPORTANT]
.PostgreSQL >= 9.4 is needed
====
in this release PostgreSQL > 9.4 is the officially recomended version because all JSON columns will be migrated to JSONB to reduce the db disk space usage and improve performance.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Changes to settings for REST_FRAMEWORK throttling.
====
If you have modified your `REST_FRAMEWORK` settings, you have to care about the changes introducted in the new version:

. In `REST_FRAMEWORK["DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES"]` you must handle the fact
  that `anon` and `user` scopes settings have been renamed and split into
  `anon-write`, `anon-read`, `user-write` and `user-read`.
. In `REST_FRAMEWORK["DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES"]` we have added new scopes of
  throttling (by default set to `None`), they are `login-fail`, `register-success`,
  `user-detail`.
. In `REST_FRAMEWORK["DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES"]` the new default throttle
  class is `taiga.base.throttling.CommonThrottle`.
====

[IMPORTANT]
.Changes to settings because celery upgrade from 3.x to 4.x.
====
We have migrated to celery 4, and split the configuration in two different
files. Therefore if you have configured any celery settings in your
`settings/local.py` you must move them to the `settings/celery_local.py`
file. Besides, before update the workers and taiga-back, ensure that your tasks
queue is completely empty because the tasks format isn't compatible (if you
can't stop your service during the upgrade, you have to follow the instructions
given by celery creators here:
http://docs.celeryproject.org/en/latest/whatsnew-4.0.html#upgrading-from-celery-3-1).
====

Follow the default process.

The migration may take a long time if you have a large database.

You should reload the fixtures with:

----
cd taiga-back
workon taiga
python manage.py loaddata initial_project_templates --traceback
----


== Upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04 system to Ubuntu 16.04

To upgrade from 14.04 to 16.04 you have to follow the official Ubuntu process:

[source, txt]
----
$ apt install update-manager-core
$ sudo do-release-upgrade -p
----

Then you have to upgrade to the new postgres version maintaining the old data:
[source, txt]
----
$ apt install postgresql-9.5 postgresql-contrib-9.5 -y
$ apt install postgresql-doc-9.5 postgresql-server-dev-9.5 -y
$ sudo pg_dropcluster 9.5 main --stop
$ sudo pg_upgradecluster 9.3 main
$ sudo reboot
----

Then you have to use the circus service from ubuntu.
[source, txt]
----
$ sudo pip uninstall circus pyzmq
$ apt install circus
$ sudo mv ~/conf/circus.ini /etc/circus/conf.d/taiga.ini
----

Rebuild your virtualenv
[source, txt]
----
$ rmvirtualenv taiga
$ mkvirtualenv taiga -p /usr/bin/python3.6
$ cd ~/taiga-back
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
----

Reboot the system
[source, txt]
----
$ sudo reboot
----


== 3.0.0 > 3.1.0

Follow the default process.

If you want to have svg thumbnail images install `cairo` library.

----
apt-get install cairo
----



== 2.1.0 > 3.0.0

[IMPORTANT]
.Extra step for instances with gogs plugin installed
====

Taiga contrib gogs plugin has been moved to taiga core so if you installed the plugin you must uninstall it first:

- In `taiga-back/settings/local.py`
    * Remove `taiga_contrib_gogs` from your `INSTALLED_APPS`
    * Remove the `PROJECT_MODULES_CONFIGURATORS["gogs"]` setting added

- In `taiga-front/dist/conf.json` remove `/plugins/gogs/gogs.json` from the `contribPlugins` section
- In `taiga-front/dist/plugins` remove the folder `gogs`
====

Follow the default process.

The migration may take a long time if you have a large database.

Now project templates can be sorted and a new permission has been added to allow users to add comments (instead of using the __modify object permission__ for this purpose). The fixtures must reloaded using:

----
cd taiga-back
workon taiga
python manage.py loaddata initial_project_templates --traceback
----


== 2.0.0 > 2.1.0

Follow the default process.


== 1.10.0 > 2.0.0

Follow the default process.

This version upgrades Django to 1.9, so if you overwrote the DB settings in `taiga-back/settings/local.py` you have to change the DB backend to use the default.

So, change...

[source,python]
----
# In Taiga <= 1.9
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "transaction_hooks.backends.postgresql_psycopg2",
        (...)
----

to:

[source,python]
----
# In Taiga >= 2.0
DATABASES = {
    "default": {
        "ENGINE": "django.db.backends.postgresql",
        (...)
----



== 1.9.1 > 1.10.0

Follow the default process.

The migration may take a long time if you have a large database.


== 1.9.0 > 1.9.1

Copy your conf.json from `taiga-front-dist/dist/js/conf.json` to `taiga-front-dist/dist/conf.json`.

Remove the following folders `dist/fonts`, `dist/images`, `dist/js`, `dist/locales`, `dist/styles`, `dist/svg`.

Download the latest version of plugins following their installation instructions.
