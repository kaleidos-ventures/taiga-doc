== Default Upgrade Process

Every new Taiga release generates new images available from link:https://hub.docker.com/u/taigaio[Docker Hub]. So the procedure to update them consists of:

* Pull the new images:
[source,bash]
----
$ docker pull taigaio/taiga-back:latest
$ docker pull taigaio/taiga-front:latest
$ docker pull taigaio/taiga-events:latest
$ docker pull taigaio/taiga-protected:latest
----

* Relaunch the services so it starts with the new images:
[source,bash]
----
$ docker-compose up -d
----

This will take care of new static and the database migrations, if any. This process means a little downtime so choose the better moment to perfom it. After this process the instance will be updated and running.
